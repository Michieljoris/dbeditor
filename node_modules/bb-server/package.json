  "readme": "bb-server\n===========\n\nBasic node server with forwarding to couchdb to get around the\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin, cobbled together from a few basic html\nservers written by other people. The couchdb forwarding comes from a\ncloudant faq, the commandline interface from\n[http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server), the basic\nserver I've forgotten where it came from. \n\nI've adapted it here and there to suit my purposes which is to have a quick\nand dirty node html server. You can have this server forward requests\nto a couchdb server, which is handy because now you can interface with\na couchdb that's from a different origin than your website/app.\n\nYou can plugin your own GET and POST handlers triggered by route.\n\nThis server is a raw server, it only requires the http and url network modules\nto function. The commandline interface requires a few more utility\nmodules.\n\nTo install clone it, cd into the directory and do:\n \n\tnpm install\n\nThen ./bin/bb-server to run it.\n\nOr do:\n\n\tnpm install -g bb\n\t\nThen bb-server to run.\n\nYou can also install it directly from npm:\n\n\tnmp install bb-server\n\t\nThough that might not be the most recent version.\t\n\t  \nCommandline usage: \n\nbb-server [path] [options],\n\n\t    options:\n          -p --port          Port to use [HTTPSERVER_PORT || 8080]\",\n          -a --address       Address to use [HTTPSERVER_IPADDR || 0.0.0.0]\",\n          -b --block         Block directory contents\",\n          -i --index         Show index.htm[l] when present in directory\",\n          -f --forward       Forward url/prefix to target\",\n          --prefix           [db]\",\n          --target           [http://localhost:5984]\",\n          --file             load options from .json file\",\n          --secure           start https server\",\n          -m                 Don't convert .md or .markdown files to html\",\n          -w                 Turn on websocket server\"\n          -s --silent        Suppress log messages from output\",\n          -h --help          Print this list and exit.\"\n\t\t  \n\t\t  \n\t\t  \nSee the example_server.js file for an example of requiring the server\nin your own module. You can then also plugin your own post and get handlers.\n\n",
